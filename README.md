# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze PyBer data from January to May 2019

## Overview

We were asked to create a summary DataFram of the ride-sharing data by city type using the knowledge of Python and Pandas and create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  

## Results

The data summary shows that there is a significant difference in the ridership in each of the city types.

Though the rural city type only has 125 total rides and 78 drivers, the average fares per ride is $30.64 and per driver, "$55.49. We would be assume that that the passenger would be going a longer distance on their ride. 
As expected, the urban city type has the highest total rides with 1,625 and 2,405 total drivers. The total fare is also bigger.  Looking at the averages, I would say that the urban passengers are taking more trips, but the distances traveled are less than suburban and rural passengers.  Because there aren't a lot of drivers in the rural area, the rural drivers are making more money per driver. 

The "Total Fare By City Type" shows the stark difference between the each type.  As discussed before, it shows that the Urban city type has the most in total fars in every month.  .  They all follow the same trends in the the months, exept for April.

## Summary

Business recommendations:
1) Market more to the rural cities.
2) Market more in the month of March in all city types as this month showed a down turn in fares for all city types.
